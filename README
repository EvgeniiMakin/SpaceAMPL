This open source projects contains the AMPL models for a number of
optimal control problems (OCP) of relevance to space engineering. All models
are converging using the default parameters provided and using the default
solver provided.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run the models the following external (commercial) dependencies are needed:

1 - AMPL (also the edition limited to 100 variables is enough)
2 - SNOPT (in its AMPL version). Alternatively one could try other solvers (open source) by
	changing the relative line in the model file.
	
Most models output the result in a text file whose format is controlled by printf statments.

As an alternative, on-line free services such as the NEOS server can be used (in which case the .mod files
could need some small modification to be adapted to the web interface)
